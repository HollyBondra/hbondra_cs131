# Machine Learning: The Process Behind Neural Networks

## Project Summary:
In my presentation, I explored how neural networks work by breaking down both the concepts and the math behind them. It covers what machine learning is, how artificial neurons function, and what happens inside the layers (input, hidden, and output). I also explain activation functions like ReLU and sigmoid, and show how neural networks learn through backpropagation using mathematical steps. Then, I explained why neural networks are important and what the future holds for this technology.

## Project Contents:

### What is Machine Learning?
Understanding the definition of machine learning and a brief description of its operation

### What is a Neural Network?
Understanding what neural networks are and a brief description of how they work

### Structure of a Neural Network
Looking at what a basic neural network is composed of, and introducing the mathematical function of a single neuron

### Neurons
Comparing biological neurons vs artificial neurons, and then breaking down the math involved in a single artificial neuron

### Activation Functions
Understanding what activation functions are and how they are used in neural networking. We look at Rectified linear units and Sigmoid functions, and then compare their graphs

### Backpropagation
Understanding what backpropagation is and explaining the steps involved, showing relevant math

### Why are Neural Networks Important?
Learning about the importance of using neural networks

### The Future of Neural Networks
Exploring what the future holds for neural networks
